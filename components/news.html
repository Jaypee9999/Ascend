                        <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-700">
                            <p>Mr. Albert Samuela (Middle left) and Ms. Geraldine Buela (Middle right), together with student interns working on the ASCEND project, met with representatives from the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) Technical Panel for Chemistry and the Office of Programs and Standards Development (OPSD) at UP Diliman on July 10, 2025.</p>
                            <p>The meeting centered on presenting the ASCEND project—a proposed database platform that bridges academic institutions and the chemical industry. Based on the meeting, the CHED Technical Panel for Chemistry expressed openness to supporting an academic-industry linkage project aimed at strengthening ties between higher education institutions and the chemical industry.</p>
                            <p>JP Dela Cruz from CHED shared that projects like ASCEND, a database platform that connects the two sectors, could gain the panel's interest, especially if it helps align research with industry needs. CHED encourages the project to be proposed in collaboration with the technical panel and include its benefits to both CHED and higher education institutions (HEIs) for possible endorsement and funding. A "pilot implementation" is advised as the first step to move the project forward.</p>
                            <p>The platform will only feature public information from HEIs and chemical companies, while detailed content will be protected as intellectual property. CHED sees no issue with private organizations leading the project, as long as plans are clear. To simplify the process, CHED recommends starting with Chemistry before involving Chemical Engineering, as the latter's panel is still being reformed. The project will also identify how industry partners contribute— through funding, internships, or jobs—to help revise and improve the chemistry curriculum in line with real-world demands.</p>
